# Project Description

## Title : Analyzing real estate rental data

## Elevator Pitch:

We obtain a collection of rental data from various sources such as Vuokraovi, Statistics Finland and Oikotie, and try to get as many attributes as possible such as bedrooms, apartment size, type of apartment, which floor, etc. We plan to start with the Helsinki region and then expand our area if time permits. We wrangle the data, explore it and then summarize and visualize it through a map of the geographical area we are considering.
