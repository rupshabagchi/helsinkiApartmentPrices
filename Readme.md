# Project Description

## A. Title : Analyzing real estate rental data
More details about the project on [report page](https://github.com/rupshabagchi/helsinkiApartmentPrices/blob/master/report.md).

## B. Pitch

We obtain a collection of rental data from various sources such as Vuokraovi, Statistics Finland and Oikotie, and try to get as many attributes as possible such as bedrooms, size, type, floor etc. We plan to start with a postal area in Helsinki, then move on to Helsinki region and then expand our area if time permits. We wrangle the data, explore it and then summarize and visualize it through a map and possibly a static webpage.

## C. Data

#### Sources:
[Vuokraovi](vuokraovi.com)

####  Wrangling and Management:

Web scraping, extracting the data, parsing the extracted data, storing it in MongoDB

## D. Data Analysis

Aggregating the data possibly using pyMongo, modelling the data.

## E. Communication of results
Visualizing the obtained results through a map.

## F. Operationalization
Using a webpage possibly hosted on Firebase to beautify the results.
